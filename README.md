# Classification Projects Repository

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of classification projects that I have developed to explore various aspects of predictive modeling. Each project demonstrates different classification techniques, methodologies, and datasets, showcasing my skills in data analysis and machine learning.

## Purpose

The primary intention of this repository is to:

- Provide a comprehensive understanding of classification analysis.
- Highlight the application of various classification models in solving real-world problems.
- Share insights and methodologies that can be beneficial for learning and reference.

## Projects Included

### Project 1: [Santander Customer Satisfaction Classification]
**Description**: Developed a deep learning model to classify customers based on their satisfaction levels (0 or 1).
**Techniques Used**: 


## Conclusion

Through these projects, I aim to deepen my understanding of classification analysis and its applications in predictive modeling. I hope this repository serves as a useful resource for anyone interested in learning more about classification techniques and their practical applications.
